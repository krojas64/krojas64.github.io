                Testing is a simple way to test individual functions of python code <br>
		to ensure that they are outputing the proper values. This is important because <br>
		as you continue adding new methods and functions to your project, the <br>
		some of the changes made will more than likely affect the output of previously <br>
		created methods. Sometimes you might find a more efficient way to create something, <br>
		which may result in overhauling a good chunk of code. This is why having a set of tests <br>
		that check your methods everytime you rewrite and build your code is extrememly important. <br>
		It'll help you find bugs in your code, ensure that your program is running smoothly, but <br>
		most importantly, that it is creating the output the way you expect it to.

		In order to create tests, you must install pytest:
		<br>
		<code>
			pip install pytest
		</code>
		<br>
		From here, you can make files that end with <code>_test.py</code>, which lets pytest know <br>
		that these files are specifically for testing. When testing a specific method, you must <br>
		import the method with the following: <br>
		<code>
			from (filepath) import (methodname)
		</code>
		<br>
		Once imported, you can create another method that will test the imported method. <br>
		There are three steps to follow: Arrange, Act, and Assert. Arranging is getting <br>
		values that are going to be used for the test. In the example below, I use a tuple <br>
		with two numbers. Then you act, which is where the result is generated from. <br>
		In this case, it is the result of using the arranged values with the Addition method. <br>
		Finally, you assert the result, and check to see if it matches with what is expected. <br>
		Act and Assert can both be done in one line, but in this case, they are separated. <br>
