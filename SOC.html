        <h1>Separation of Concerns</h1>
        <a href="index.html">Return to Main Page</a>

        <div>
		The main idea of separation of concerns is making sure that certain <br>
		parts of code don't serve multiple functions. Code that is meant to <br>
		calculate or determine different values should stay together, and not <br>
		spread around wherever it may be convenient. For example, in this <a href=https://github.com/krojas64/calc2/tree/statictest>GitHub repo</a> we can see that the <br>
		caluclations and tests are within their respective directories. Looking <br>
		into each directory, we can see that each part is separated based on what <br>
		purpose they serve. In calc, we have an operations directory, where the <br>
		calculation base class and other operations are kept. They all serve a <br>
		similar purpose, which is why they are kept in this order. <br> <br>
		Meanwhile the tests are also separated based on the different operation they test, <br>
		but again, they are kept in a similar location. <br>
		If we had tests running within the operation files, this would violate the <br>
		single responsibility principle which dictates that parts of code should <br>
		mainly serve a single purpose. <br>
