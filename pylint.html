	<h1>Pylint Intro</h1>
	<a href="index.html">Return to Main Page</a>
	<div>
		Pylint is desgined to check your code in order to see if it meets the general <br>
		standards of how Python code should be written. If your code works well, but <br>
		looks messy and is nearly impossible to read, then you will have problems <br>
		in the future. Pylint will give you warnings on what is missing in your code <br>
		and adjustments that should be made to improve readability.

		In order to use Pylint, you must install it using:
		
		<pre>
                <code>
                pip install pylint
                </code>
                </pre>

		Afterwords you must go into the directory you want to run pylint on. From here <br>
		you can set which file you would like pylint to run on. For example, on the <br>
		following <a href="https://github.com/krojas64/calc2/tree/main">Github page</a>, <br>
		if we wanted to test the main file, we would run:

		<pre>
		<code>
		pylint calculator/main.py
		</code>
		</pre>
	</div>
	<div>
		Pylint is used so the terminal knows that we are running pylint on a file, and <br>
                the second argument is used to determine the filepath of the file to run pylint on. <br>
                Once run, the terminal will check the entire file and print out a list of errors <br>
                and warnings, explaining what is causing the error. This is where adjustments can be <br>
                made to your code, and as the number of errors decreases, your overall score will <br>
                also increase, indicating that your code is closer to the standard.

		<h3>General Terms to know in Python</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Factory - A method in a class that is used to create objects, however it does not<br>
			instantiate the object. Subclasses that inherit the object will determine what<br>
			the object does.
			</li>
			<li>Object - What most "things" (for lack of better term) in Python are made up of.<br>
			Objects have properties that can determine what it is, what it should run, and how <br>
			it is affected by other objects.
			</li>
			<li>Class - A method that has other methods used to create and define objects. They <br>
			handle initialization of the object, which for example, a fatory method would be used.
			</li>
			<li>Namespace - A list of names that are currently being used to refer to a specific <br>
			value, object, or method. Once a name has been used, that name can be called to <br>
			get the value or method associated with it.
			</li>
			<li>Constructor - A method used to instantiate an object. This methos specifically <br>
			defines what variables the object has and what it can do with those variables <br>
			</li>

		</ul>
